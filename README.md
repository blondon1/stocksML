Twitter Sentiment Analysis for Stock Market Prediction

Project Overview
This project aims to analyze the sentiment of tweets related to specific stock symbols and correlate these sentiments with stock market movements. By streaming live tweets, performing sentiment analysis, and tracking stock price changes, we seek to uncover potential patterns or signals that could predict stock price trends.

The system utilizes Python for data processing, Tweepy for accessing the Twitter Streaming API, VaderSentiment for sentiment analysis, and Elasticsearch for data storage and analysis.

Features
Live Tweet Streaming: Tracks tweets in real-time based on specified stock symbols.
Sentiment Analysis: Analyzes the sentiment of each tweet to determine whether it's positive, negative, or neutral.
Stock Price Tracking: Fetches historical and current stock prices for correlation analysis.
Data Storage: Uses Elasticsearch to store and analyze tweet sentiments and stock prices efficiently.
Technology Stack
Python 3.x
Tweepy
VaderSentiment
Elasticsearch
Kibana (optional, for data visualization)
Prerequisites
Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following:

Python 3.6 or later installed.
An Elasticsearch cluster running locally or remotely.
Twitter Developer Account with access to the Twitter API.
(Optional) Kibana setup for data visualization.
Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/<blondon1>/stocksml.git
cd twitter-sentiment-stock-prediction
2. Install Dependencies
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Configure Application
Create a config.py file in the root directory and update it with your Twitter API credentials and Elasticsearch configuration:

python
Copy code
# Twitter API Credentials
consumer_key = 'YOUR_CONSUMER_KEY'
consumer_secret = 'YOUR_CONSUMER_SECRET'
access_token = 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN'
access_token_secret = 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET'

# Elasticsearch Configuration
elasticsearch_host = 'localhost'
elasticsearch_port = 9200
elasticsearch_index = 'stocksight'
4. Run Elasticsearch Setup (Optional)
If you're running Elasticsearch locally and haven't set up an index yet, execute the following script to create one:

bash
Copy code
python elasticsearch_setup.py
5. Start the Application
bash
Copy code
python main.py
Usage
Once started, the application begins streaming tweets related to the configured stock symbols, analyzing their sentiments, and correlating these with stock price movements. Results are stored in Elasticsearch for further analysis or visualization.
